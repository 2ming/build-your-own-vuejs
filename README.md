# Build your own Vuejs

> This project is working in progress, stay tuned.

This repository includes *Build your own Vuejs* book and the code for it.

In the book *Build your own Vuejs*, we will build a Vuejs from scratch. And you will learn how Vuejs works internally, which helps a lot for your daily development with vue. 

Inspired by the amazing book *Build your own Angularjs*, the code of *Build your own Vuejs* will be developed in a test-driven way. 

We'll focus on Vuejs 2.0. And we assume our reader have played around with Vuejs once and know basics about Vuejs APIs.
